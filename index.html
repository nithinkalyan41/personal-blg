    <p>About 20 workers of the Telugu Desam Party, including some women, were injured in a mild police lathi-charge at Pedduru village of Shantipuram mandal in the Kuppam Assembly Constituency, on Wednesday.</p>
    <p>Tension prevailed all over the Kuppam Assembly Constituency after the police, who were enforcing the G.O No. 1 norms, tried to prevent Telugu Desam Party workers who were proceeding towards the Kuppam-Karnataka border to welcome the party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu at Pedduru village.

    </p>
    <p>As part of Mr. Naidu’s three-day visit to Kuppam to conduct the “Idhemi Karma” programme, a pandal was erected at Pedduru village, meant for Naidu’s proposed Rachcha Banda programme. With Mr. Naidu’s arrival expected at the border village in the afternoon from Bengaluru, about 500 police personnel were deployed at the venue, and the latter had erected barricades to prevent the party activists.</p>
